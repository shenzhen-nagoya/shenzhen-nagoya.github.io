        <strong>Power and limitation of distributed quantum proofs</strong>
        <!--<a href="./SN22/QLi.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        Distributed quantum proofs (or dQMA: distributed quantum Merlin-Arthur proofs) 
        were introduced by Fraigniuad, Le Gall, Nishimura, and Paz [FLNP21]. 
        They gave efficient dQMA protocols for some problems such as the equality of the data on a network. 
        In this talk, I report some improvements on their results and efficient dQMA protocols 
        for other problems such as ranking verification and Hamming distance. 
        Moreover, the first lower bound results on the proof size and communication cost are reported. 
        The talk is based on Ref. [HKN24], a joint work with Atsuya Hasegawa and Srijita Kundu.

        <strong>Space-bounded quantum state testing and its applications</strong>
        <a href="./slides/YLiu.pdf">slide</a><br>
        We present a new complete characterization of space-bounded
        quantum computation, focusing on problems with one-sided error (unitary coRQL) 
        and two-sided error (BQL) from a quantum state testing perspective.
        These promise problems tell whether efficiently preparable states in logarithmic qubits 
        are far from each other concerning trace distance,
        quantum entropy difference, and Hilbert-Schmidt distance. 
        Unlike the time-bounded state testing problems, we show that all space-bounded state
        testing problems correspond to the same class. 
        Additionally, our algorithms on the trace distance inspire an algorithmic Holevo-Helstrom measurement,
        implying QSZK is in QIP(2) with a quantum linear-space honest prover. 
        Our primary technique is a space-efficient variant of the quantum singular value transformation 
        (QSVT), which gives a unified approach to designing space-bounded quantum algorithms.

        <strong>Reliability Function of Classical-Quantum Channels</strong>
        <!--<a href="./SN22/Takahashi.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        We study the reliability function of general classical-quantum channels, 
        which describes the optimal exponent of the decay of decoding error 
        when the communication rate is below the capacity. 
        As main result, we prove a lower bound, in terms of the quantum Renyi information in Petz's form, 
        for the reliability function. 
        This resolves Holevo's conjecture proposed in 2000, a long-standing open problem 
        in quantum information theory. 
        It turns out that the obtained lower bound matches the upper bound derived by Dalai in 2013, 
        when the communication rate is above a critical value. 
        Thus we have determined the reliability function in this high-rate case. 
        Our approach relies on Renes' breakthrough made in 2022, 
        which relates classical-quantum channel coding to that of privacy amplification, 
        as well as our new characterization of the channel Renyi information.

        <strong>Francois Le Gall</strong> 
        (Graduate School of Mathematics, Nagoya University)<br>
        <strong> Online Locality Meets Distributed Quantum Computing</strong>
        <a href="./slides/LeGall.pdf">slide</a><br>
        We extend the theory of locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs) 
        from the classical LOCAL model to a number of other models that have been studied recently, 
        including the quantum-LOCAL model, finitely-dependent processes, non-signaling model, 
        dynamic-LOCAL model, and online-LOCAL model [e.g. STOC 2024, ICALP 2023].
        First, we demonstrate the advantage that finitely-dependent processes have 
        over the classical LOCAL model. 
        We show that all LCL problems solvable with locality O(log n) in the LOCAL model 
        admit a finitely-dependent distribution (with constant locality). 
        In particular, this gives a finitely-dependent coloring for regular trees, 
        answering an open question by Holroyd [2023]. 
        This also introduces a new formal barrier for understanding the distributed quantum advantage: 
        it is not possible to exclude quantum advantage for any LCL in the &Theta;(log n) 
        complexity class by using non-signaling arguments. 
        Second, we put limits on the capabilities of all of these models. 
        To this end, we introduce a model called randomized online-LOCAL, 
        which is strong enough to simulate e.g. SLOCAL and dynamic-LOCAL,
        and we show that it is also strong enough to simulate any non-signaling distribution 
        and hence any quantum-LOCAL algorithm. 
        We prove the following result for rooted trees: 
        if we can solve an LCL problem with locality o(loglogn) in the randomized online-LOCAL model, 
        we can solve it with locality O(log n) in the classical deterministic LOCAL model. 
        Put together, these results show that in rooted trees the set of LCLs that can be solved 
        with locality O(log n) is the same across all these models: 
        classical deterministic and randomized LOCAL, quantum-LOCAL, non-signaling model, dynamic-LOCAL, 
        and deterministic and randomized online-LOCAL. 
        This talk is based on arXiv:2403.01903.

        <strong>Time-efficient quantum entropy estimator via samplizer</strong>
        <a href="./slides/QWang.pdf">slide</a><br>
        Entropy is a measure of the randomness of a system. 
        Estimating the entropy of a quantum state is a basic problem in quantum information. 
        In this paper, we introduce a time-efficient quantum approach to estimating the von Neumann 
        entropy S(&rho;) and Rényi entropy S_&alpha;(&rho;) of an N-dimensional quantum state &rho;, 
        given access to independent samples of &rho;. 
        Specifically, we provide the following quantum estimators.
        1. A quantum estimator for S(&rho;) with time complexity O~(N^2), improving the prior best time 
        complexity O(N^6) by Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020) 
        and Bavarian, Mehraba, and Wright (2016).
        2. A quantum estimator for S_&alpha;(&rho;) with time complexity O~(N^(4/&alpha;−2)) 
        for 0 &lt; &alpha; &lt; 1 and O~(N^(4−2/&alpha;)) for &alpha;>1, 
        improving the prior best time complexity 
        O~(N^(6/&alpha;)) for 0 &lt; &alpha; &lt; 1 and O~(N^6) for &alpha;>1 
        by Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020), 
        though at a cost of a slightly larger sample complexity.
        Moreover, these estimators are naturally extensible to the low-rank case. 
        We also provide a sample lower bound &Omega;(max{N/&epsilon;,N^(1/&alpha;-1)/&epsilon;^(1/&alpha;)}) 
        for estimating S_&alpha;(&rho;).
        Technically, our method is quite different from the previous ones 
        that are based on weak Schur sampling and Young diagrams. 
        At the heart of our construction, is a novel tool called samplizer, which can "samplize" 
        a quantum query algorithm to a quantum algorithm with similar behavior using only samples of 
        quantum states; this suggests a unified framework for estimating quantum entropies. 
        Specifically, when a quantum oracle U block-encodes a mixed quantum state &rho;, 
        any quantum query algorithm using Q queries to U can be samplized to a &delta;-close 
        (in the diamond norm) quantum algorithm using &Theta;~(Q^2/&delta;) samples of &rho;. 
        Moreover, this samplization is proven to be optimal, up to a polylogarithmic factor.

        <strong>Measurement incompatibility in multi-parameter quantum estimation</strong>
        <!--<a href="./SN22/Minami.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        The incompatibility of the optimal measurements for the estimation of different parameters 
        constraints the achievable precisions in multi-parameter quantum estimation. 
        Understanding the tradeoff induced by such incompatibility is 
        thus a central topic in quantum metrology. 
        Here we generalize the measurement uncertainty relations to characterize the tradeoff relations. 
        We demonstrate the power of the approach with a few examples.

        <strong>Asymptotic dimensional analysis on unitary representation and 
                its application to measuring quantum relative entropy</strong>
        <a href="./slides/Hayashi.pdf">slide</a><br>
        In this study, we first discuss the asymptotic analysis 
        on the dimension of irreducible unitary representation. 
        Using this result, we study the estimation of relative entropy $D(&rho;|&sigma;)$ 
        when &sigma; is known. 
        We show that the Cram&eacute;r-Rao type bound equals the relative varentropy. 
        Our estimator attains the Cram&eacute;r-Rao type bound when the dimension $d$ is fixed. 
        It also achieves the sample complexity $O(d^2)$ when the dimension d increases. 
        This sample complexity is optimal when &sigma; is the completely mixed state. 
         Also, it has time complexity $O(d^6 \polylog d)$. 
        Our proposed estimator unifiedly works under both settings.

        Let $G$ be the general linear group $SL_n(C)$, and let $T$ be its maximal torus. 
        This study focuses on the $T$-equivariant K-homology ring $K_*^T(Gr_G)$ 
        of the affine Grassmannian $Gr_G$ of $G$. 
        In this talk, I would like to outline two realizations of $K_*^T(Gr_G)$. 
        One is the realization through the algebra $\hat{\Lambda}^{R(T)}_G$, 
        which is spanned by the "double K-$k$-Schur functions" representing Schubert classes. 
        The other is the realization through the ring of regular funations 
        $O(Z_G)$ of the affine variety $Z_{G^\vee}$ over $T$. 
        This talk is based on joint work with Takeshi Ikeda and Mark Shimozono.

        <strong>Twist field deformations in string field theory</strong>  
        <!--<a href="./SN22/RXu.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        The background independence of string field theory states that classical solutions to 
        string field equations of motion correspond to string backgrounds, 
        idly spacetime with D-branes, fluxes and/or orbifolds. 
        One example of these solutions is the exactly marginal deformations of the worldsheet CFT. 
        We start with a marginal deformation of the twist field and solve 
        for exact marginality perturbatively. 
        For open strings it is a D3-D(-1) system describing a point-like Yang-Mills instanton 
        deformed into a finite-sized one. 
        We are also able to reproduce the ADHM constraint on the moduli. 
        For closed strings it describes resolution of an orbifold singularity and 
        there is no constraint on the moduli.

        <strong> 4dim WZW models and unification of integrable systems</strong> 
        <!--<a href="./SN22/Matsuo.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        Four-dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten (4dWZW) models are analogues of two-dimensional WZW models 
        and describe string field theory actions of the open N=2 string theory 
        in the four-dimensional space-time with the split signature (+,+,-,-). 
        The equations of motion of 4d WZW models are equivalent to anti-self-dual Yang-Mills (ASDYM) 
        equations which are, in the solit signature, reduced to various integrable equations 
        such as KdV, Toda equations. 
        On the other hand, 4d Chern-Simons (CS) theories give rise to various solvable models 
        such as spin chains and principal chiral models. 
        Furthermore, a 6dCS theory yields the 4dWZW model and 4dCS theory as a double fibration. 
        This is considered to be a unified theory of integrable systems. 
        In this talk we discuss the 4dWZW model and construct soliton solutions in it. 
        We find that the multi-solitons behave as the KP-type solitons, that is,

        <strong>The 2-character theory of finite 2-groups</strong> 
        <!--<a href="./SN22/ASBai.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        The character plays an important role in the representation theory of finite groups. 
        In this talk, I will introduce the notion of 2-character of 2-representations 
        of a finite 2-group $\mathcal{G}$. 
        The conjugation invariance implies that the 2-characters can be viewed as objects 
        in the Drinfeld center $\mathfrak{Z}_1(\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathcal{G}})$. 
        I will also introduce a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) point of view 
        on the 2-characters and show that they are Lagrangian algebras 
        in $\mathfrak{Z}_1(\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathcal{G}})$. 
        If time permits, I will also discuss the orthogonality of 2-characters, 
        which categorifies the classical orthogonality of characters.

        Pontryagin duality of Abelian groups plays an important role 
        in representation theory of groups and Fourier transforms. 
        I would like to introduce the Pontryagin duality for symmetric 2-groups, 
        with Mo Huang and Zhi-Hao Zhang in our recent project. 
        We will see that very few examples of finite symmetric 2-group have Pontryagin self duality, 
        in contrast with the fact that every finite Abelian group is Pontryagin self dual. 
        We can also categorify the notion of Fourier transform, 
        and use it to help us understand the general structure of representations of 2-groups.

        <strong>Dynamic quantum circuit compilation</strong>
        <!--<a href="./SN22/LeGall.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        Quantum computing has shown tremendous promise in addressing complex computational problems, 
        yet its practical realization is hindered by the limited availability of qubits for computation. 
        Recent advancements in quantum hardware have introduced mid-circuit measurements and resets, 
        enabling the reuse of measured qubits and significantly reducing the qubit requirements 
        for executing quantum algorithms. 
        In this work, we present a systematic study of dynamic quantum circuit compilation, 
        a process that transforms static quantum circuits into their dynamic equivalents 
        with a reduced qubit count through qubit-reuse. 
        We establish the first general framework for optimizing the dynamic circuit compilation 
        via graph manipulation. 
        In particular, we completely characterize the optimal quantum circuit compilation 
        using binary integer programming, provide efficient algorithms for determining whether 
        a given quantum circuit can be reduced to a smaller circuit and present heuristic algorithms 
        for devising dynamic compilation schemes in general. 
        Furthermore, we conduct a thorough analysis of quantum circuits with practical relevance, 
        offering optimal compilations for well-known quantum algorithms in quantum computation, 
        ansatz circuits utilized in quantum machine learning, 
        and measurement-based quantum computation crucial for quantum networking. 
        We also perform a comparative analysis against state-of-the-art approaches, 
        demonstrating the superior performance of our methods in both structured and random quantum circuits. 
        Our framework lays a rigorous foundation for comprehending dynamic quantum circuit compilation 
        via qubit-reuse, bridging the gap between theoretical quantum algorithms 
        and their physical implementation on quantum computers with limited resources.

        <strong>Symmetry-Based Quantum Circuit Mapping</strong>
        <!--<a href="./SN22/YYao.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        Quantum circuit mapping plays a vital role in the quantum circuit compilation process. 
        It involves transforming a logical quantum circuit into a set of instructions 
        that can be directly executed on a target quantum system. 
        A recent advancement in this field is the introduction of a post-compilation technique 
        called remapping. 
        Remapping aims to adjust the initial circuit mapping to reduce errors in quantum circuits 
        caused by system variations. 
        In this study, we introduce a quantum circuit remapping algorithm that leverages 
        the inherent symmetries found in quantum processors to reduce computational complexity. 
        Our algorithm effectively identifies all topologically equivalent circuit mappings 
        by utilizing symmetries to narrow down the search space and 
        employing vector computation for quicker evaluation. 
        Notably, our symmetry-based remapping algorithm exhibits a linear time complexity 
        and is proven to be optimal. 
        Numerical experiments were conducted to compare our approach with existing methods in the field, 
        showcasing its superior performance on typical quantum hardware architectures.

        <strong>Operational approaches to information and thermodynamics</strong>
        <!--<a href="./SN22/Arai.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        Information theory and thermodynamics are now being extended 
        beyond classical theory into quantum theory. 
        Along with this, the close relationship between the two has also been elucidated. 
        The question then arises as to how far information theory and 
        thermodynamics can be extended operationally and to what extent the close relationship 
        between the two is universal beyond the mathematical structure of the theory. 
        In this presentation, we would like to introduce our two approaches to these questions. 
        In Ref. [1], we operationally extend von Neumann's thought experiment that was used to define 
        entropy in quantum theory and discuss the conditions imposed on entropy 
        in terms of its consistency with the second law of thermodynamics. 
        In Ref. [2], we discuss the operational validity of the relationship between classical capacity 
        and hypothesis testing, which Wang and Renner [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 200501 (2012)] 
        provided in quantum theory. <br>

        <strong>How to Certify Deletion with Constant-Length Verification Key</strong>
        <!--<a href="./SN22/Panupong.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        The certified deletion process involves transmitting a ciphertext and 
        confirming its deletion via a digital certificate. 
        In this context, the term "deletion" refers to the fact that no information-processing procedure 
        can decipher the cyphertext if the certificate is valid. 
        Those familiar with cryptography can recognize this type of cipher as 
        being computationally secure before and informationally secure after deletion. <br>
        Let $\lambda$ and $n$ be the security parameter and length of the message sent. 
        We proposed a method for Certified Deletion that needs only $O(\lambda)$ bit of verification key, 
        while to my knowledge, all the prior works need at least $O(\lambda n)$ bit of verification key. 
        Imagine someone who wants to store 1GB of data on a server in a deletable manner; 
        then the previous methods need to store 1GB of metadata, while ours do not. 
        Our method uses PRF (short for Pseudo-random Functions) to generate certificates 
        and its key as the verification key. 
        Also, we conclude our result in a general form as the prior works [BK23,BKMPW23,KNY23] did. 
        So, applying our result the same way as in the prior works gets the same applications. <br>
        The key's length concerns storage costs and key leakage risks, 
        and we are the first to attempt to reduce that. 
        General ways to realize Certified Deletion are known [BK23, BKMPW23] 
        and our result can be seen as an essential adaption to improve efficiency in practice. <br>

        <strong>Squashed information backflows in non-Markovian quantum stochastic processes</strong>
        <!--<a href="./SN22/Hayashi.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        It is well known that convex combinations of Markov processes typically result in non-Markov ones. 
        In this talk I will review some notions of (non-)Markovianity for quantum stochastic processes 
        focusing in particular on a recent proposal to quantify information back-flows 
        after classical memories have been suitably squashed out. 
        Such a "squashed" non-Markovianity, besides suggesting a notion of "genuine" or "causal"
        information revivals, is also able to resolve the problem of non-convexity, 
        thus clarifying the role of non-Markovianity as a resource.
        The possibility of extending the same intuition to other non-convex resource theories is discussed.

        <strong>On the generic increase of observational entropy in isolated systems</strong>
        <!--<a href="./SN22/CYBai.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        The concept of observational entropy, which unifies various forms of entropy, 
        including Boltzmann's, Gibbs's, von Neumann's macroscopic entropy, and the diagonal entropy, 
        has recently been proposed as a pivotal element 
        in a contemporary formulation of statistical mechanics. 
        In this study, we employ algebraic techniques derived from Petz's theory of 
        statistical sufficiency and a Levy-type concentration bound to demonstrate rigorous theorems. 
        These theorems illustrate how the observational entropy of a system undergoing 
        a unitary evolution chosen at random tends to increase with overwhelming probability 
        and to reach its maximum very quickly. 
        We demonstrate that for any observation that is sufficiently coarse
        with respect to the size of the system, the random evolution renders 
        the system's state practically indistinguishable from the uniform distribution 
        (i.e., maximally mixed) with a probability approaching one as the system size increases. 
        This is true regardless of the initial state of the system, whether pure or mixed. 
        The same conclusion is applicable not only to random evolutions sampled 
        according to the unitarily invariant Haar distribution, but also to approximate 2-designs, 
        which are regarded as a more physically reasonable means of modelling random evolutions.

        <strong>Exact renormalization flow for matrix product density operators</strong>
        <!--<a href="./SN22/Garoufalidis.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        Matrix Product Density Operators (MPDO) is a class of one-dimensional (1D) tensor network 
        typically used to describe thermal states and steady states of dissipative dynamics. 
        MPDO is a generalization of Matrix Product States (MPS), 
        which can describe 1D pure states efficiently. 
        MPS is known to be connected to 1D gapped ground states, and its classification is done by
        studying the fixed points of exact real-space renormalization flow. 
        In this talk, we study exact renormalization flow for MPDO to characterize the descriptive capability.
        We find that unlike MPS, MPDO does not admit exact renormalization flows in general. 
        We then analyze MPDO with a well-defined renormalization flow and show that 
        these MPDO can be characterized by some kind of non-invertible symmetries.
