        <strong>On the Pieri formula of the super Macdonald polynomials</strong>
        <!--<a href="https://shenzhen-nagoya.github.io/2025/slides/.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        The super Macdonald polynomials generalize the Macdonald polynomials
        to the super space with Grassmann coordinates.
        They are indexed by a set of super partitions and give a basis of
        a level zero representation of the quantum toroidal algebra of type gl<sub>1|1</sub>.
        We derive the Pieri formula of the super Macdonald polynomials
        from the action of the raising and the lowering operators of the algebra.
        We also present a conjecture on the Pieri formula, from which
        we can compute the commuting Hamiltonians.
        The super Macdonald polynomials are characterized as simultaneous
        eigenfunctions of these Hamiltonians.

        We formulate a string field theory for open N=2 strings with an homotopy algebra structure. 
        Starting from the BRST cohomology relative to the $U(1)$ anti-ghost zero-mode, 
        we generalize [arXiv:1312.2948] and constructed all interacting vertices recursively 
        and without singularity.

        <strong>Classical Algorithms for Constant Approximation
                of the Ground State Energy of Local Hamiltonians</strong>
        <!--<a href="https://shenzhen-nagoya.github.io/2025/slides/.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        In this talk I will explain how to construct classical algorithms computing
        an approximation of the ground state energy of 
        an arbitrary k-local Hamiltonian acting on n qubits. <br>
        I will first consider the setting where a good guiding state is available, 
        which is the main setting where quantum algorithms are expected to achieve
        an exponential speedup over classical methods.
        I will explain how to significant improve the recent classical algorithm 
        by Gharibian and Le Gall (SICOMP 2023) and match (up a to polynomial overhead) 
        both the time and space complexities of quantum algorithms 
        for constant approximation of the ground state energy. <br>
        For the setting where no guided state is given 
        (i.e., the standard version of the local Hamiltonian problem), 
        I will present a classical algorithm computing a constant approximation of 
        the ground state energy in 2<sup>O(n)</sup> time and poly(n) space. 
        Before this work it was unknown how to classically achieve these bounds simultaneously, 
        even for constant approximation. <br>

        <strong>Tensor Networks and Hybrid Architectures for Scalable and 
                Robust-Resilient Quantum Machine Learning</strong>
        <!--<a href="https://shenzhen-nagoya.github.io/2025/slides/.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) hold promise as building blocks for quantum machine learning, 
        but their deployment in the Noisy Intermediate‚ÄêScale Quantum (NISQ) era is hindered 
        by limited expressivity, trainability issues (e.g., barren plateaus), and sensitivity to noise. 
        In a series of recent works, we develop hybrid quantum-classical architectures that systematically
        address these limitations via tensor-train (TT) parameterizations and hybridisation 
        with classical neural networks. 
        I will present three interlinked models: TTN-VQC, TensoMeta-VQC, and VQC-MLPNet, 
        emphasizing their theoretical foundations, empirical performance, 
        and practical implications for scalable and noise-resilient quantum machine learning.

        <strong>Quantum Metrology Enhanced by Leveraging Informative Noise with Error Correction</strong>
        <!--<a href="https://shenzhen-nagoya.github.io/2025/slides/.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        Noise is a central obstacle to practical quantum technologies, 
        typically inducing decoherence that erodes quantum advantage. 
        Yet certain noise processes are informative about the parameters of interest and, 
        when properly harnessed, can improve metrological performance. 
        While such effects have been noted for specific channels, 
        their scope under general dynamics remains unclear. 
        In this work, we show that informative noise, combined with quantum error correction, 
        can be converted into a resource for precision enhancement. 
        We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which metrological precision 
        in the presence of informative noise attains Heisenberg scaling. 
        These results provide a unified criterion for when noise can be beneficial and 
        offer a constructive route to designing error-corrected sensing protocols 
        that approach fundamental limits.

        <strong>Principal Elements and fermion-boson harmonic oscillator</strong>
        <!--<a href="https://shenzhen-nagoya.github.io/2025/slides/.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        Let g be a complex simple Lie algebra and G the adjoint group of g. 
        The principal element of G corresponds to the Coxeter element and the Fourier element 
        corresponds to the longest element of the Weyl group. 
        We define the Fourier operators for either a split or compact real form G(R) 
        and show that they act on unitary representations of G(R) in a way similar to
        the bosonic Fourier transform on the oscillator representation of symplectic group or 
        the fermionic Fourier transforms on the spin representation of orthogonal group.
        This framework fits in the superspace analysis and reveals the spectral decomposition of
        the hybrid Fourier transform for an interactive fermion-boson system.

        <strong>Vertex Lie bialgebras</strong>
        <!--<a href="https://shenzhen-nagoya.github.io/2025/slides/.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        Vertex algebras (VAs) are fundamental objects in mathematical physics,
        particularly in the study of two-dimensional conformal field theory.
        As their classical counterparts, vertex Poisson algebras (VPAs) arise naturally. 
        A typical example is that the jet algebra of an ordinary Poisson algebra. <br>
        In this talk, we investigate the jets of Poisson Hopf algebras, 
        which corrponds to Poisson‚ÄìLie groups. 
        This leads us to the notion of vertex Poisson Hopf algebras, and, 
        at the level of tangent spaces, to that of vertex Lie bialgebras. 
        Finally, I will introduce the quantization problem for vertex Lie bialgebras, 
        which serves as a natural extension of the quantization theory for Lie bialgebras.

        <strong>Factorization envelopes and enveloping vertex algebras</strong>
        <!--<a href="https://shenzhen-nagoya.github.io/2025/slides/.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        Costello-Gwilliam factorization algebras are mathematical objects that encode 
        the algebraic structure of observables in quantum field theories. 
        On the other hand, vertex algebras provide an algebraic framework 
        for two-dimensional chiral conformal field theories. 
        Costello and Gwilliam developed a general method for constructing vertex algebras 
        from factorization algebras on the complex plane. 
        They also constructed factorization algebras via factorization envelopes, 
        corresponding to the affine vertex algebras and the beta-gamma vertex algebra. 
        Since these vertex algebras are particular instances of enveloping vertex algebras of 
        vertex Lie algebras, it is natural to seek a generalization of their construction 
        to arbitrary vertex Lie algebras. 
        In this talk, after a brief introduction to factorization algebras and vertex algebras, 
        I will explain this generalization, namely the construction of factorization algebras 
        starting from vertex Lie algebras.

        <strong>Fully quantum Bayes' rule from the minimum change principle</strong>
        <!--<a href="https://shenzhen-nagoya.github.io/2025/slides/.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        Bayes' rule, which is routinely used to update beliefs based on new evidence, 
        can be derived from a principle of minimum change. 
        This principle states that updated beliefs must be consistent with new data, 
        while deviating minimally from the prior belief. 
        Here, we introduce a quantum analog of the minimum change principle and use it to derive 
        a quantum Bayes' rule by minimizing the change between two quantum input-output processes, 
        not just their marginals. 
        This is analogous to the classical case, where Bayes' rule is obtained by minimizing 
        several distances between the joint input-output distributions. 
        When the change maximizes the fidelity, 
        the quantum minimum change principle has a unique solution, 
        and the resulting quantum Bayes' rule recovers the Petz transpose map in many cases. 
        This is work done in collaboration with Ge Bai and Valerio Scarani. <br>

        <strong>Quantum Recurrent Embedding Neural Networks</strong>
        <!--<a href="https://shenzhen-nagoya.github.io/2025/slides/.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        Quantum neural networks have emerged as promising quantum machine learning models, 
        leveraging the properties of quantum systems and classical optimization to solve
        complex problems in physics and beyond. 
        However, the pursuit of quantum advantage in this field faces a paradoxical tradeoff: 
        where the QNN architectures with proven trainability can possess 
        bounded dimensional Lie algebraic structures, potentially losing quantum advantage, 
        even they can resist the most susceptible gradient vanishing. 
        In this work, we propose a quantum recurrent embedding neural network (QRENN), 
        a versatile framework that tightly integrates tunable QNN components with quantum data embedding, 
        inspired by fast-track information pathways in ResNet, 
        and grounded in quantum circuit architecture theory. 
        Through rigorous theoretical analysis using the dynamical Lie algebra formalism, 
        we provide a rigorous proof of the trainability of QRENN circuits, 
        demonstrating that this deep quantum neural network can avoid barren plateaus. 
        Notably, the general QRENN architecture resists classical simulation 
        as it encompasses powerful quantum circuits such as QSP, QSVT, and DQC1, 
        which are widely believed to be classically intractable. 
        Building on this theoretical foundation, we apply our QRENN to accurately classify 
        quantum Hamiltonians and detect symmetry-protected topological phases, 
        demonstrating its applicability in quantum supervised learning. 
        Our results highlight the power of recurrent data embedding in quantum neural networks 
        and the potential for scalable quantum supervised learning 
        in predicting physical properties and solving complex problems.

        on input y send their quantum messages to the third party Referee, and
        the aim is that Referee computes f(x,y) for a function f.  
        However, its multiparty version has not been well-studied in the literature. 
        In this talk, I will report known results and open problems on this version. 
        The talk will be mainly based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08091">arXiv:2412.08091</a>.

        <strong>An em algorithm for quantum Boltzmann machines</strong>
        <!--<a href="https://shenzhen-nagoya.github.io/2025/slides/.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        We develop a quantum version of the em algorithm for training quantum Boltzmann machines. 
        The em algorithm is an information-geometric extension of the well-known 
        expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, offering a structured alternative to 
        gradient-based methods with potential advantages in stability and convergence. 
        We implement the algorithm on a semi-quantum restricted Boltzmann machine, 
        where quantum effects are confined to the hidden layer. 
        This structure enables analytical update rules while preserving quantum expressivity. 
        Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves 
        stable learning and outperforms gradient-based training in several cases. 
        These results demonstrate the potential of information-geometric optimization for 
        quantum machine learning, particularly in settings where standard methods struggle due to 
        non-commutativity or vanishing gradients.

        <strong>The Hopf Superalgebra of Two‚ÄëColored Graphs</strong>
        <!--<a href="https://shenzhen-nagoya.github.io/2025/slides/.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        We investigate Hopf superalgebras and establish that the Hopf superalgebra 
        of quasisymmetric functions in superspace, sQSym, is the terminal object 
        in the category of all combinatorial Hopf superalgebras.
        Moreover, we show that the ring of symmetric functions in superspace is
        the terminal object in the category of all combinatorial cocommutative
        Hopf superalgebras.
        As an example of a combinatorial cocommutative Hopf superalgebra, 
        we construct one from connected simple two‚Äëcolored graphs and demonstrate that
        it serves as a super-analogue of Stanley's chromatic symmetric functions. <br> 
        This talk is based on joint work with Masamune Hattori and Shintaro Yanagida, 
        "On the Hopf superalgebra of symmetric functions in superspace", 
        online published in Bull. Lond. Math. Soc., 2025;

        <strong>ADHM Construction of Instantons</strong>
        <!--<a href="https://shenzhen-nagoya.github.io/2025/slides/.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        Instantons are solutions of Anti-Self-Dual (ASD) Yang-Mills equations with 
        finite-action boundary conditions and play important roles in quantum field theory
        and four-dimensional geometry. 
        There is one-to-one correspondence between the moduli space of instantons and 
        the moduli space of ADHM data. (ADHM=Atiyah-Drinfeld-Hitchin-Manin.) 
        The former is defined by matrix-valued nonlinear partial differential equations and 
        the latter by matrix equations. 
        ADHM construction is based on this one-to-one correspondence (reciprocity). 
        Instantons solutions are obtained just by solving problems of linear algebra. 
        In this talk, we review ADHM construction/reciprocity of instantons from the viewpoint 
        of Fourier-Mukai-Nahm transformation. 
        If time allows, extension to noncommutative spaces is also discussed.

        <strong>Bialgebraic structure and 
                exact renormalization flow of mixed 1D tensor network states</strong>
        <!--<a href="https://shenzhen-nagoya.github.io/2025/slides/Nishimura.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
	Generalized symmetries beyond onsite unitary actions are central to 
        understanding exotic quantum phases of matter. 
        In tensor network approaches, these symmetries are represented by matrix product operators (MPOs), 
        but the conventional frameworks of fusion categories and weak Hopf algebras 
        fail to capture many physically relevant cases. 
        I will show that the algebraic structure underlying MPOs can be formulated 
        as a non-counital pre-bialgebra, providing a natural generalization of existing descriptions. 
        As a concrete example, 
        I will discuss the mixed anomaly of the XX model and its lattice realization. 
        I will also explain how a subclass of matrix product density operators (MPDOs) 
        admits an exact renormalization group flow governed by such bialgebras, 
        offering new insights into the classification of mixed-state quantum phases.

        <strong>Does there exist a quantum fingerprinting protocol without coherent measurements?</strong>
        <!--<a href="https://shenzhen-nagoya.github.io/2025/slides/.pdf">slide</a>--><br>
        Buhrman, Cleve, Watrous, and de Wolf (PRL 2001) discovered the quantum fingerprinting protocol, 
        which is the quantum SMP protocol with S(log n) qubits communication for the equality problem. 
        In the protocol, Alice and Bob create some quantum fingerprints of their inputs, 
        and the referee conducts the SWAP tests for the quantum fingerprints. 
        Since &Omega;(&radic;n) bits communication is required with the classical SMP scheme 
        for the equality problem first shown by Newman and Szegedy (STOC 1996), 
        there exists an exponential quantum advantage in the amount of communication.<br>
        In this talk, we consider a setting in which the referee can do only incoherent measurements 
        rather than coherent measurements including the SWAP tests. 
        We first show that, in the case of one-way LOCC measurements, 
        &Omega;(&radic;n) qubits communication is required. 
        To prove the result, we derive a new method to replace quantum messages by classical messages 
        and consider a reduction to the optimal lower bound in the hybrid SMP model 
        where one message is quantum and the other is classical, 
        which was first shown by Klauck and Podder (MFCS 2014). 
        Our method uses the result of Oszmaniec, Guerini, Wittek, and Ac&iacute;n (PRL 2017), 
        who showed that general POVM measurements can be simulated by 
        randomized projective measurements with small ancilla qubits, and Newman's theorem.
        We further investigate the setting of quantum SMP protocols with two-way LOCC measurements, 
        and derive a lower bound against some restricted two-way LOCC measurements. 
        To prove it, we revisit the technique to replace quantum messages 
        by classical deterministic messages introduced by Aaronson (ToC 2005) 
        and generalized by Gavinsky, Regev, and de Wolf (CJTCS 2008), and show that, 
        using the deterministic message, the referee can simulate the two-way LOCC measurements.
